Collect the following information:
- All new Github issues opened yesterday or today
- All issues labeled 'bug' that were updated since yesterday
- All issues labeled 'feature' that were updated since yesterday

Create a triage report to help me prioritize and manage issues effectively.
Use the following template to organize the content by topic and priority:

(BEGIN TEMPLATE)

# Triage Report for <date>

<one paragraph summary of the current state of issues>

## Critical Issues
<list of critical issues with in-line links>

## Bugs
<list of bugs with in-line links>

## Features
<list of feature requests with in-line links>

(END TEMPLATE)

---

Guidelines for writing the report:
- Use personal, concise, informative language.
- Identify common topics / parts of the code that are talked about / affected
- Topics should be content-oriented, e.g. not "Github issues" but "CLI history feature" or "Bug in dashboard"
- Include in-line links to the original issues, files, and people involved
- The report should read like a personalized summary, not a list of links/issues
- Use emojis to make the report more engaging
