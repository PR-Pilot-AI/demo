We ran our unit tests.
```python3 test_fibonacci.py``` ran in `analyze-test-results/`: on my local machine, here's the output:
---
{{ sh('python3 test_fibonacci.py') }}
---

If the tests are green, do nothing. Otherwise:
1. Analyze the test output and understand which code changes caused the tests to fail
2. Respond with an analysis:
   - Which tests failed, including Markdown links to the files
   - Code snippets that show the changes that caused the tests to fail
   - A suggestion for how to fix the code and/or tests


Do not change anything, only respond with the analysis.
