# Extract and Apply Style Guidelines to and from Documents

Maintaining a consistent style across your repositories and documents is essential for a professional and polished 
appearance. Style guidelines help ensure that your content is clear, engaging, and visually appealing. 

**However**, enforcing these guidelines is difficult at best:
- In order to comply, **authors need to be aware** of the guidelines.
- Authors need to **remember** the guidelines while writing.
- Enforcing the guidelines is **manual and time-consuming**.

## üéØ Goal
This demo showcases how PR Pilot can help you **extract style guidelines** from existing documents and **apply them** to new ones.


## üõ†Ô∏è How it works

We define style guidelines as a set of rules and recommendations that dictate the formatting, tone, and structure of your documents:

```markdown
- Use emojis in headers to make the content more engaging.
- Include badges for release notes, CI status, license, and downloads at the top of the document.
- Use in-line links for references instead of lists or reference links.
- Maintain a friendly and personal tone throughout the document.
- Highlight key words or word groups in **bold** to facilitate quick scanning by the reader.
- Ensure the document starts with a clear and concise title followed by a brief description.
- Align badges horizontally at the top of the document for a clean look.
```

In [run.sh](run.sh), we use [extract-guidelines.md.jinja2](extract-guidelines.md.jinja2) to extract style guidelines from three sources:

* The [langchain README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langchain-ai/langchain/master/README.md)
* The [Spring Boot README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/main/README.adoc)
* The [PR Pilot CLI README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot-cli/main/README.md)

The guidelines are saved as Markdown files in [styles](styles) for reference,
where they can be applied to new documents using [apply-guidelines.md.jinja2](apply-guidelines.md.jinja2).

## Make it your own
You can customize this technique in creative ways:
- **Extract guidelines from different sources**: Use different documents or websites to extract guidelines.
- **Apply guidelines to different types of documents**: Apply guidelines to READMEs, blog posts, or documentation.
- **Create a style guide template**: Use a template to define your own style guidelines and apply them to new documents.
- **Automate the process**: Use scripts to automatically extract and apply guidelines to documents in your repository.

By using PR Pilot to extract and apply style guidelines, you can **ensure that your content is consistent, professional, 
and visually appealing** across all your repositories and documents.
