### Analysis of the `daily-report` Demo

#### Developer Pain Point
The demo addresses the common developer pain point of manually gathering and summarizing daily updates from multiple Github repositories. This includes checking for new issues, unresolved bug tickets, and the status of ongoing development efforts. This routine can be time-consuming and prone to oversight.

#### How PR Pilot CLI Helps
The PR Pilot CLI automates the process of collecting and summarizing information from Github repositories. Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. **Collect Information**: The CLI gathers data from specified Github repositories.
2. **Generate Report**: Using a Jinja template, the CLI organizes the collected data into a structured report.
3. **Deliver Report**: The report is saved as a Markdown file in a designated directory.

#### Main Benefits for the User
- **Time-Saving**: Automates the daily routine of gathering and summarizing information.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the report is generated in a consistent format every day.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the report template and the information collected to suit their specific needs.
- **Integration**: Can be run as a Github Action for seamless integration into the development workflow.

#### Detailed Illustration

**CLI Command in `run.sh`**:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

projects=("PR-Pilot-AI/demo" "PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot" "PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot-cli")
today=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')

for project in "${projects[@]}"; do
  echo "Generating report for $project"
  mkdir -p "$project"
  pilot --no-sync --verbose --repo "$project" task -o "$project/$today.md" -f generate-report.md.jinja2
done
```
- **Command Explanation**:
  - `pilot --no-sync --verbose --repo "$project" task -o "$project/$today.md" -f generate-report.md.jinja2`: This command uses the PR Pilot CLI to generate a report for each specified project. The report is saved in a Markdown file named with the current date.

**Jinja Template in `generate-report.md.jinja2`**:
```jinja
Collect the following information:
- All new Github issues opened yesterday or today
- All new pull requests opened yesterday and today
- All issues labeled 'bug' that were closed since yesterday

Create a report for me to read in the morning, so that I can catch up on what happened yesterday.
Use the following template to organize the content by topic and priority:

(BEGIN TEMPLATE)

# Daily Report for <date>

<one paragraph summary of the day>

## Highlights
<one or two things that seem extra important or urgent>

## <Topic 1>
<What I need to know about topic 1, with in-line links>

## <Topic 2>
<What I need to know about topic 2, with in-line links>

## <Topic n>
...

(END TEMPLATE)
```
- **Template Explanation**:
  - The template specifies the information to be collected and how it should be organized in the report.
  - It includes sections for a summary, highlights, and detailed topics with in-line links to relevant issues and pull requests.

### Conclusion
The `daily-report` demo showcases how PR Pilot can automate the creation of daily reports, saving developers time and ensuring consistency. By using the CLI and customizable Jinja templates, users can tailor the reports to their specific needs and integrate the process into their daily workflow. This enhances productivity and keeps the team informed with minimal effort.
