# Iterative Research

We are iteratively researching an open-ended question by creating a knowledge base that
looks at the question from different angles and perspectives.
With every iteration, we refine the knowledge base by taking an item from the backlog,
researching it, and adding it to the knowledge base.

## Question

What will be the impact of AI on the future of work?

## Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is a directory with markdown files.
Each file represents a perspective or an angle on the question.
The **file index** is a table of contents for the knowledge base,
listing each file with a brief description.
The **backlog** is a list of perspectives or angles that we plan to research next.
