# Iterative Research

We are iteratively researching an open-ended question by creating a knowledge base that
looks at the question from different angles and perspectives.
With every iteration, we refine the knowledge base by taking an item from the backlog,
researching it, and adding it to the knowledge base.

## Question

What will be the impact of AI on the future of work?

## Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is a directory with markdown files.
Each file represents a perspective or an angle on the question.
The **file index** is a table of contents for the knowledge base,
listing each file with a brief description.
The **backlog** is a list of perspectives or angles that we plan to research next.

### File Index
- [The Role of AI in Automating Routine Tasks](role-of-ai-in-automating-routine-tasks.md): This document explores how AI is being used to automate routine tasks, its efficiency gains, workforce implications, and future trends.
- [AI's Impact on Job Creation and Destruction](ai-impact-on-job-creation-and-destruction.md): This document examines the multifaceted impact of AI on job creation and destruction, including job displacement, new job opportunities, and policy implications.

### Backlog
1. AI's impact on job creation and destruction
2. Ethical considerations in AI deployment in workplaces
3. The future of AI-human collaboration
4. AI in enhancing remote work and virtual collaboration

## Research Guidelines
* Research MUST be backed by credible sources
* Sources MUST be references in the knowledge base
* Each perspective or angle SHOULD be concise, focused and put in the context of the question
