We are doing iterative research.

1. Read `iterative-research/index.md` to understand how it works
2. If the backlog is empty, fill the backlog with new perspectives or angles to research
3. Pick an item from the backlog and research online
4. Write a markdown file with your findings in the `iterative-research` directory
5. Add the new file to `index.md` and remove the item from the backlog
