We are looking for new, interesting use cases for PR Pilot.
We have collected a number of proposals and want to find the top 3 ones based on a number of criteria.

# Existing proposals
{{ sh(['find', 'proposals', '-type', 'f', '-exec', 'cat', '{}', ';']) }}

# Selection Criteria
Evaluate and rank the proposals based on the following criteria:
- LLM neccessity - Is this use case already covered by established tools (linters, formatters, etc.)?
- Novelty and WOW effect - How surprising and innovative is the use case?
- Effort-to-gain ratio - How much effort is required to implement the use case and how much value does it provide?

# Your Task
1. Evaluate and rank the existing proposals based on the selection criteria
2. Respond with a concise list of the top 3 proposals and a brief explanation for each
