We are looking for new, interesting use cases for PR Pilot.
We have collected a number of proposals and want to find the top 3 ones based on a number of criteria.

# Existing proposals
{{ sh(['find', 'proposals', '-type', 'f', '-exec', 'cat', '{}', ';']) }}

# Selection Criteria
Evaluate and rank the proposals based on the following criteria:
- LLM neccessity - Is this use case already covered by established tools (linters, formatters, etc.)?
- Novelty and WOW effect - How surprising and innovative is the use case?
- Effort-to-gain ratio - How much effort is required to implement the use case and how much value does it provide?

# Your Task
1. Evaluate and rank the existing proposals based on the selection criteria
2. Respond with the following:
  - The number 1 proposal explained in detail, with examples and why it ranked highest
  - The 2nd and 3rd proposals explained in brief paragraphs
  - A numbered list, ranking proposals 4-n with name only
  - Use eomijs everywhere to make it more visual and engaging
