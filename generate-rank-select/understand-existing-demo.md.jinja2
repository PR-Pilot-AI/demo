I want you to understand a PR Pilot demo.

Each demo is in its onw sub-directory. The README.md file in each demo directory explains how to run the demo.
The `run.sh` file in each demo directory uses the CLI to implement the demo use case.
It may refer to Jinja templates in the same directory.

Analyze the demo in the `{{ env('DEMO_DIR') }}` sub-directory step-by-step:

0. Scrape the CLI documentation: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot-cli/main/README.md
1. List the files in the sub-directory
2. Read the README.md file to understand the demo
3. Read the `run.sh` file to understand how the CLI is used in the demo
4. Read any other relevant files referenced in the `run.sh` file

I want to know the following:
- Which developer pain point does the demo solve?
- How does the PR Pilot CLI help in solving the pain point?
- What are the main benefits for the user?
- Use snippets of the CLI commands and Jinja templates to illustrate in detail

Respond with your analysis.
