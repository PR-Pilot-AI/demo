Each demo is organized into sub-directories (e.g., `pr-description`) and includes a `README.md` and `run.sh` file. The `README.md` provides guidance and explains the use case and benefits, while the `run.sh` file uses the CLI to implement the demo use case. The project emphasizes a friendly, personal tone with engaging elements like emojis and highlights key words for easy scanning. PR Pilot aims to save time and help users stay in the flow by allowing them to delegate routine tasks to AI through prompts."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which demos do we have in here?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are the demos available in this project:\n\n- \ud83d\udcca **analyze-test-results**\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **config-file-madness**\n- \ud83d\udcac **conversation**\n- \ud83d\udcc5 **daily-report**\n- \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f **game-of-life**\n- \ud83d\udcdd **generate-dummy-content**\n- \ud83d\udcc8 **generate-rank-select**\n- \ud83d\udc1e **instant-bug-ticket**\n- \ud83d\udd0d **multi-search**\n- \ud83d\udcdd **pr-description**\n- \ud83d\udca1 **prompts**\n- \u2705 **quality-gate**\n- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f **screenshot-to-code**\n- \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **step-by-step-plan**\n- \ud83c\udfa8 **style-guidelines**\n\nEach demo showcases different features and capabilities of PR Pilot, helping you understand how to leverage the tool in various scenarios."}]
