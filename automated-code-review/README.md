# Automated Code Review with PR Pilot

## Developer Pain Point

Developers often spend a significant amount of time manually reviewing code for common issues, such as style violations, potential bugs, and adherence to best practices. This process can be tedious and prone to human error.

## How PR Pilot CLI Helps

The PR Pilot CLI can automate the code review process by analyzing the codebase, identifying issues, and providing suggestions for improvements. Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. **Analyze Codebase**: The CLI scans the codebase for common issues and potential improvements.
2. **Generate Report**: Using a Jinja template, the CLI organizes the findings into a structured report.
3. **Deliver Report**: The report is saved as a Markdown file in a designated directory.

## Main Benefits for the User

- **Time-Saving**: Automates the code review process, allowing developers to focus on more complex tasks.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that code reviews are thorough and consistent.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the review criteria and the report template to suit their specific needs.
- **Integration**: Can be run as a pre-commit hook or as part of a CI/CD pipeline for seamless integration into the development workflow.

## Detailed Illustration

**CLI Command in `run.sh`**:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

project="PR-Pilot-AI/demo"
today=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')

mkdir -p "$project"
echo "Running code review for $project"
pilot --no-sync --verbose --repo "$project" task -o "$project/$today-code-review.md" -f code-review-report.md.jinja2
```
- **Command Explanation**:
  - `pilot --no-sync --verbose --repo "$project" task -o "$project/$today-code-review.md" -f code-review-report.md.jinja2`: This command uses the PR Pilot CLI to run a code review for the specified project. The report is saved in a Markdown file named with the current date.

**Jinja Template in `code-review-report.md.jinja2`**:
```jinja
Collect the following information:
- All style violations (e.g., PEP 8 issues) in the codebase
- All potential bugs identified by static analysis
- Suggestions for improving code quality and adherence to best practices

Create a report for me to review, so that I can address the issues and improve the code quality.
Use the following template to organize the content by category and priority:

(BEGIN TEMPLATE)

# Code Review Report for <date>

<one paragraph summary of the code review>

## Style Violations
<list of style violations with in-line links to the relevant code sections>

## Potential Bugs
<list of potential bugs with in-line links to the relevant code sections>

## Suggestions for Improvement
<list of suggestions for improving code quality and adherence to best practices>

(END TEMPLATE)
```
- **Template Explanation**:
  - The template specifies the information to be collected and how it should be organized in the report.
  - It includes sections for style violations, potential bugs, and suggestions for improvement, with in-line links to the relevant code sections.

## Conclusion

The `automated-code-review` demo showcases how PR Pilot can automate the code review process, saving developers time and ensuring consistency. By using the CLI and customizable Jinja templates, users can tailor the reviews to their specific needs and integrate the process into their development workflow. This enhances productivity and helps maintain high code quality with minimal effort.
