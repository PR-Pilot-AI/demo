Collect the following information:
- All new Github issues opened yesterday or today
- All new pull requests opened yesterday and today
- All open issues labeled 'bug' or 'critical'

Create a report for me to read in the morning, so that I can catch up on what happened yesterday.
Use the following template to organize the content by topic and priority:

(BEGIN TEMPLATE)

# Daily Report for <date>

<one paragraph summary of the day>

## Highlights
<one or two things that seem extra important or urgent>

## <Topic 1>
<What I need to know about topic 1, with in-line links>

## <Topic 2>
<What I need to know about topic 2, with in-line links>

## <Topic n>
...

(END TEMPLATE)

Guidelines for writing the report:
- Use personal, concise, informative language.
- Identify common topics / parts of the code that are talked about / affected
- Topics should be content-oriented, e.g. not "Github issues" but "CLI history feature" or "Bug in dashboard"
- Include in-line links to the original issues, files, and people involved
- The report should read like a personalized summary, not a list of links/issues
- Use emojis to make the report more engaging

Generate the report!
