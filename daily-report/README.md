# Example: Daily Reports for Github Repositories

Every developer has their routine in the morning:
- See if there's any new issues on Github
- Get an overview of currently unresolved bug tickets
- Check the status of ongoing development efforts
- etc

With PR Pilot, you can automate the process of collecting and summarizing this information, creating a daily report that you can read in the morning to catch up on what happened yesterday.

## How it works

Running [run.sh](run.sh) will:

1. **Collect Information**: PR Pilot gathers data from Github and other tools to summarize the day's activities from a list of Github repos
2. **Generate Report**: Using a template, PR Pilot organizes the information into a structured report.
3. **Deliver Report**: The report is saved as a Markdown file in `daily-reports/<OWNER>/<REPO>/<DATE>.md`

## Example Output

Running the script might look something like this:

```bash
Generating report for PR-Pilot-AI/demo
✔ Task created: 1c8d1b65-30a8-45b6-b737-38ac56306984 (0:00:00.00)

```

We've saved some of the reports generated by PR Pilot in the [daily-reports/PR-Pilot-AI](daily-reports/PR-Pilot-AI) directory for you
so you can see what it can look like.

## Make it your own
This example is just a starting point. You can customize the report template and the information collected to suit your needs.

Some ideas that might inspire you:
- Add instructions to **summarize new Slack messages** from a specific channel
- Include a section on **recently closed issues** to highlight progress
- **Post the report to Slack** for easy access
- Add instructions to find **new Linear issues** created by your team
