name: Create a new PR Pilot Integration
prompt: |
  We are adding a Sentry integration to PR Pilot. Users will be able to enter their API key in the dashboard
  and PR Pilot will use its agent tools to search the Sentry API for issues and events.
  
  An integration is composed of the following:
  - A dashboard page with:
    - An HTML template in `dashboard/templates/integrations/`
    - A view controller in `dashboard/views/integrations.py`
  - A Django model in `accounts/models.py` to store credentials
  - A set of langchain agent tools in `agents/integration_tools/`
steps:
  - name: Create Django model
    prompt: |
      1. Add the Django model for storing the Sentry API key
      2. Add a migration for the new model to `accounts/migrations/`
  - name: Update dashboard template
    prompt: |
      The template currently contains no form and says "coming soon".
      It should allow the user to enter their Sentry API key.
      If an API key is already stored, it should show a delete button like in the example.
      1. Read `dashboard/templates/integrations/slack.html` to understand how the template works
      2. Update the `dashboard/templates/integrations/sentry.html` template to include a form for the API key
  - name: Update view controller
    prompt: Update the `IntegrationView` class in `dashboard/views/integrations.py` to handle the form submission.
  - name: Create agent tools
    prompt: |
      1. Read `engine/agents/integration_tools/slack_tools.py` to understand how agent tools work
      2. Implement Sentry agent tools in `engine/agents/integration_tools/sentry_tools.py`
      3. Write unit tests for the new tools in `engine/agents/tests/test_sentry_tools.py`
      4. Understand the tool registration mechanism in `engine/agents/integration_tools/__init__.py` and add the new tools
  - name: Create PR title and description
    prompt: |
      1. Create a PR title that summarizes the changes
      2. Write a PR description that explains the purpose of the integration and the changes made
      3. Replace existing PR description and title with the new ones
