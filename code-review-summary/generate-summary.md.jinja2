Collect the following information:
- All pull requests reviewed yesterday or today
- All pull requests merged yesterday or today
- All comments made on pull requests since yesterday

Create a summary for me to read, so that I can catch up on the latest code reviews and changes.
Use the following template to organize the content by topic and priority:

(BEGIN TEMPLATE)

# Code Review Summary for <date>

<one paragraph summary of the day>

## Highlights
<one or two things that seem extra important or urgent>

## <Topic 1>
<What I need to know about topic 1, with in-line links>

## <Topic 2>
<What I need to know about topic 2, with in-line links>

## <Topic n>
...

(END TEMPLATE)

---

Guidelines for writing the summary:
- Use personal, concise, informative language.
- Identify common topics / parts of the code that are talked about / affected
- Topics should be content-oriented, e.g. not "Pull requests" but "Refactoring of authentication module" or "New feature in dashboard"
- Include in-line links to the original pull requests, files, and people involved
- The summary should read like a personalized overview, not a list of links/issues
- Use emojis to make the summary more engaging
