Collect the following information:
- All files changed in the last PR
- Review the code for coding standards and best practices
- Identify any potential issues or improvements

Create a review report for me to read, so that I can ensure all coding standards are met and track requested changes.
Use the following template to organize the content by topic and priority:

(BEGIN TEMPLATE)

# Code Review for <date>

<one paragraph summary of the review>

## Highlights
<one or two things that seem extra important or urgent>

## <File 1>
<What I need to know about file 1, with in-line links>

## <File 2>
<What I need to know about file 2, with in-line links>

## <File n>
...

Guidelines for writing the review:
- Use personal, concise, informative language.
- Identify common issues or improvements in the code
- Topics should be content-oriented, e.g. not "Code issues" but "Improvement in function X" or "Bug in module Y"
- Include in-line links to the original files and people involved
- The review should read like a personalized summary, not a list of issues
- Use emojis to make the review more engaging
